    <h1> Frequently Asked Questions </h1>
    
    <main>
        
        <h2> Do I need to bring linens or will they be provided?  </h2>
       
        You can either bring your own linens or we can provide them for you. Linens that are provided will include a 10$ fee per linen set.  <br> <br>
        
        <h2> What should I do if I need to cancel my reservation? </h2>
       
        The best thing to do is to call as soon as possible. Our cancellation policies are listed under the rates page. Depending on time of cancellation, it is possible that there could be no refund for late cancellations, as it is hard to boook a cabin last minute and this is a lost cabin stay.  <br> <br>
       
        <h2> Where can I shop for groceries during my stay?  </h2>
       
        There is a small town about 15 minutes from the cabins with a grocery store and a few gas stations. The town is Hillsboro, and GPS will easily take you there. There is also Ontario which has a gas station.  <br> <br>
        
        <h2> Is there wifi or tv in the cabins? </h2>
        There is a tv in every cabin, although there is no reception. There are movies available in the cabins to watch. Because we believe that a cabin stay in the woods is a great way to "get away" from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, we do not have wifi in the cabins. This is a great opportunity to take a break from technology!
        
        <h2> Will my cell phone get service if I need to make a call? </h2>
        Verizon is usually the only carrier that recieves service in this area, but if you need to make a phone call and are not getting service, you can walk or drive up the hill leading out of the valley and will be able to get service here. 
        
        <h2> How secluded are the cabins? </h2>
        Most of the cabins are barely visible from each cabin porch. The cabins sit within a 3/4 mile stretch of each other, and trees provide lots of privacy. 
        
        <h2> Are pets allowed in the cabins? </h2>
        
        Our only pet cabin is our Bird's Nest Cabin, and pets are allowed with prior arrangement. Please see the Rates page for more information. 
        
        <h2> Is smoking allowed in the cabins? </h2>
        For the safety and comfort of others, we do not permit smoking in the cabins. Please dispose of your cigarettes properly, so others can enjoy their cabin stay and surroundings free of litter.
