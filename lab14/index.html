                <h2 id="intro"> A maze is a network of paths and hedges designed as a puzzle through which one has to find a way. Play all different types of maze games to entertain you for hours!</h2>
                  
                  <h3>The Rules </h3>

                <p> Maze Maker is a maze generator. Every time you run it, a different maze is generated. You start at the entrance at the upper left and work your way through the maze to the exit at the lower right. All mazes are solvable.  

                    This is not an interactive game. Once the maze generation is complete, you're on your own. You can solve the maze by tracing the paths as they appear on your screen, or, better, print them out so you can use a pen or pencil.</p>

                <h3> Modes of Play</h3>

                <p>You can select the size of the maze you wish to generate by adjusting the width and height parameters. You can also adjust the size of the maze -- large blocks are easier on the eyes, but you can't fit as complicated a maze on the screen or on a printout. We have found 30 by 20 mazes (with small block size) to be ideal for screen viewing, while 30 by 30 mazes seem to be best for printing. Your results, however, will vary depending on your screen resolution and printer.</p>

                <h3> Saving Your Game</h3>

                <p>It is not possible to save a maze by bookmarking the page, as the behavior of the other games on this site might lead you to believe. The only reliable way to save a particular maze is to print it out. Depending on your browser, you might be able to select File/Save As... and save the maze to a file on your hard drive. This will only work if your browser also saves the images used to display the maze.
                </p>
            
                <h2> A Brief History of Mazes</h2>

                <p>What exactly is a maze? What have mazes been used for throughout history? How have mazes been used in pop culture? Brush up on your maze trivia before visiting the BIG Maze, a large-scale maze in the Museum's Great Hall.

                Is a labyrinth the same thing as a maze?
                Though the words are often used interchangeably, the answer is no.

                07.2014 LabyrinthA labyrinth has winding, curved passages, forming a "unicursal," or one-way path from the outside toward the center. Walking through a labyrinth, you will change direction often, but should not get lost or confused as you wind through the space. Often the labyrinth is purposefully engineered so that it takes a long time to get to the middle, encouraging slow, meditative contemplation while navigating many twists and turns.

                07.2014 MazeA maze is filled with dead ends. Often there are puzzles that help you find your way and alleviate frustration, but the idea is to get lost a few times before figuring out the terrain and finding your way through. Two-dimensional mazes offer the ability to see the entire course at one time, though the hardest ones will take time to solve. While labyrinths are often seen as thoughtful, peaceful spaces for quiet reflection, mazes tend to attract those more interested in solving puzzles and facing challenges.</p>

 

                <h3>DID YOU KNOW? </h3>
                <p> The word "maze" dates from the 13th century and comes from the Middle English word mæs, denoting delirium or delusion. The word "labyrinth" may date as far back as the 14th century, and derives from the Latin labyrinthus and the Greek labýrinthos, or, a building with intricate passages.</p>
