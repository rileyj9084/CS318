        <h3> About Us </h3>
        Hello!  We are a family business located in the heart of the mid-west that offers log cabin rentals. Nestled in Southwestern Wisconsin, near Ontario, our log cabins are very secluded in a woods setting, with hiking, biking, canoeing all within minutes. We are family oriented and would love to have your family visit! A little about us, my name is Joe and my wife Le Ann and I run this resort. I was a former professor and teacher, while Le Ann is a 5th grade school teacher at Hillsboro Elementary School. Our two kids, Riley (daughter, oldest) and Skyler (son, youngest) are 21 and 19. Riley is a Junior Marketing Major at the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire and Skyler is a Freshman Engineering Major at the University of Wisconsin Stout. Some other family members include our dog, Annie, who enjoys running and long naps in the sun along with our two cats, Butterscotch and Frick. When you come and visit, you may also see several of our horses, and are welcome to come and feed them (they love apples!). All of us here are excited to meet you. Enjoy your stay at Pleasant Valley!
