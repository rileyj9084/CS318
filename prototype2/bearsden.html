        <h3> About the Cabin </h3>
        The Bear's Den Cabin was built in 2005. Our most luxurious, this cabin has a glorious view and a very unique design.  There are three levels, with a walkway leading to the bedroom.  The beautifully tiled bathroom includes a deep-set bathtub for a relaxing soak. With kitchen, bath, living room and bedroom this cabin provides all the comforts of home.  There is a covered porch that provides a view of the valley in a private setting.  The bear theme creates a welcoming atmosphere and the perfect "up-north" feel.  This cabin is the perfect romantic getaway setting for a weekend, a honeymoon, or a week long excursion.  On a rainy day, snuggle up to a good book or watch a classic movie on the tv (no reception. dvd/vcr only). No pets are permitted in this cabin.
