         <h3> Canoeing and Kayaking the Kickapoo </h3>
       
        We are located by the Kickapoo river, and have canoes and kayaks for rent. Contact Joe Fisher at (608)633-0029 or stop by the house to set up a canoeing and kayaking adventure! The river is located in the historic town of Ontario which meanders for 120 miles. Shuttle service and maps are provided so that you can choose where you would like to launch and take-out along the way if you decide to rent elswhere.  "Kickapoo" means  crooked river.  It winds through continuous rock formations, Wildcat Mountain State Park, and even an occasional dairy farm!  An abundant amount of wildlife will be seen along the banks of the river.  Pack a picnic and pull-out onto a sandy beach to enjoy the serene beauty and solitude.
        
         <h3> Wildcat Mountain State Park </h3>
        
        Looking for an adventure? Take a hike at Wildcat Mountain State Park. The park contains 3,400 acres of nature's beauty at its best.  There are many hiking trails and a wondrous outlook point that looks over the small town of Ontario.  A large variety of wild animals, birds and wild flowers will be spotted since a large area of the park is a wildlife refuge. There are also twelve miles of horseback riding trails, accessed through rental or bring your own!
        
        <h3> Elroy Sparta State Bike Trail</h3>

        The Elroy Sparta Bike Trail is an especially appealing trail with three rock tunnels, no more than a 3% grade, 32 miles long, and great views of the countryside.  The trail provides direct access to the "400" Bike Trail and the Omaha Bike Trail.  Bike rentals are available locally.

        <h3>Trout Fishing</h3>

        Billings creek is within 1 mile of the cabin and has undergone extensive habitat work. It is lightly fished and provides great solitude.  Public access is excellent and significant trout numbers exist.  The west fork of the Kickapoo is nearby and yields sizeable browns.   A state trout stamp is needed.
