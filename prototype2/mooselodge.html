        <h3> About the Cabin </h3>
        
         The Moose Lodge was built in 2002. This cabin, decorated in moose decor, is fantastic for large groups!  It is a 5 bedroom with 2 baths and will accommodate up to 12 people.  Located in the woods, it offers a very unique rustic experience. This cabin is three levels, with a cozy living room on the first floor with a televesion (no reception) and a sitting area with board games for all. The kitchen is located on the second floor with a door to an outside porch overlooking the woods. There is another porch located on ground level, perfect for sitting outside and enjoying the scenery or a bonfire. This cabin is also located near the beginning of a walking trail. No pets are permitted in this cabin.
